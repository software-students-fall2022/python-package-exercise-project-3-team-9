# Python Package Exercise

A little exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Pypassgen - A simple password generator

### Description:

Pypassgen has 4 functions that assist the user in creating their passwords:

1. Generating a random password based on the user's input criteria (e.g., all numeric, all alphabetic, uppercase, etc.)
2. Verify if a user's entered password is secure.
3. Encrypt the user's input string into a secured password based on the package's specific encryption rules.
4. Decrypt the user's encrypted password back to its original form provided that the password was orginally encrypted by pypassgen.
